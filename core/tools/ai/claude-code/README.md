## Description

Claude Code is Anthropic's AI-powered coding assistant that runs directly in your terminal. It leverages Claude's advanced language models to help with code generation, debugging, refactoring, and answering technical questions. Zero-Termux provides three installation methods: native with glibc support for best performance, native + proot to bypass "bad system call" errors, or via proot-distro Ubuntu container.

## Dependencies

- **Native mode:** glibc-repo, glibc, clang, curl, tar
- **Native + proot mode:** proot
- **Proot mode:** proot-distro, curl, ca-certificates

## Install

```bash
core install ai --claude-code
```

## Uninstall

```bash
core uninstall ai --claude-code
```

## Update

```bash
core update ai --claude-code
```

## Notes

- Native installation (recommended): runs directly with glibc support via a C bootstrapper
- Proot-distro (alternative): runs inside an Ubuntu container for compatibility
- The installer will prompt you to select which method to use
- Data directory: `~/.local/share/zero-termux-data/claude/`
